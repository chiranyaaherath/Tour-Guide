		accompanied by the local monkeys swinging through the trees, and then begin the ascent up the slope through fields of chilli, tomato, lemon grass and avocado, and look 
		out for eucalyptus, banana and jack fruit trees. You also pass a large tea plantation and fascinating tropical plants like the Venus fly trap.</h4></span></font>

		<span<h4>When you play golf in Nuwara Eliya you will be transported back a hundred years to Sri Lanka’s British colonial days – at times, you might even feel like you’re in the Scottish Highlands
		until you look closely at the tropical plants and flowers surrounding you. Built by a Scottish soldier of the Golan Highlanders for the British servicemen and 
		officials stationed here in 1889, the course is truly spectacular, set 6,200ft above sea level, surrounded by rolling tea hills and framed by looming mountains. 
		Nuwara Eliya – known as ‘Little England’ – is a charming hill station which was developed by British planters in the late 1800s. This is evident throughout the town: 
		as well as a golf club, the British built a racecourse, tea factories, colonial hotels and planters’ bungalows, all of which seem to be frozen in time in a bygone era.</h4></span></font>

		<span<h4>Wherever you are in the Sri Lanka highlands you are never far from a waterfall. There are more than a hundred, some of them quite inaccessible,
		some of them fairly small, but many are worth a trek as part of a day’s activity when you are looking for some exercise in the hill country. 
		Although they are at their finest at times of higher rainfall, a trip to a waterfall in Sri Lanka is always a great way to pass a few hours.</h4></span></font>
